4. **Title: Smart Portable Device for Trekking People in the Forest]**.
- **Duration: 1st Feb’24 – 12th Feb’24.**
- **Team Size: 4**
- **Summary: We designed and developed an automated surveillance system using wireless technology to detect and notify the presence of animals, enhancing monitoring and safety in various environments.

Used Tools and Methods:
We used hardware devices such as Micro Controller, Sound recognition module, Buzzer, Fire sensor, Voice IC, WSN Module, Speaker, and Cameras. Also used Software Embedded C and Arduino IDE. The method we used in this project is Wireless Communication using sound recognition.

Working Principle:
The proposed system comprises two sections: The monitoring section and the Venture section, in the monitoring section, a sound recognition module is implemented to monitor certain areas of coverage. It senses the animal sound in that region continuously. If the animal is detected, then its presence information is transmitted to nearby other monitoring sections as well as to the venture section which is in the range of coverage via wireless sensor network (WSN) and also activates a buzzer alert. Fire sensors are used to monitor the occurrence of fire in forest regions. The venture section consists of a WSN that receives and transmits data. After receiving the information, the presence of the animal is intimated by producing voice output in a nearby connected Mobile phone.

##CERTIFICATION:
